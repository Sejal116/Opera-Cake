Opera Cake is a rich French dessert, that uses one of the most loved flavor combinations, chocolate and coffee. The cake is consisting of layers of almond sponge cake soaked in coffee syrup, filled with coffee buttercream and chocolate ganache and topped with chocolate glaze. For an elegant finish its name is written on top of each slice and is decorated with gold leaf.
This recipe is time consuming, no doubt about that, but each step is quite easy to prepare and the work can easily be divided for 2 days. The final result is rewarding and really satisfying. Donâ€™t be intimidated by the volume of work or ingredients, I encourage you to try this recipe as will definitely be a crowd pleasure. Enjoy!
The history of this type of cake is a bit muddled. 
One thing we do know, however, is that its thin layers of coffee-soaked almond cake are sandwiched between an espresso-flavored buttercream, a bittersweet chocolate ganache, and topped off with a second rich chocolate ganache. Light but rich, this pastry is a real showstopper.
